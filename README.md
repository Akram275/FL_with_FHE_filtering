## ðŸ”’ Robust Federated Learning via Encrypted SVM Filtering

This repository implements a Byzantine-resilient aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FL) by filtering malicious client updates using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).  
Crucially, filtering is done **directly over Fully Homomorphically Encrypted (FHE) updates** using the **CKKS** encryption scheme â€” ensuring privacy is preserved throughout.

SVMs are trained on shadow updates representing both benign and adversarial behaviors, allowing the server to filter encrypted updates in a privacy-preserving and attack-aware manner.

### Highlights
-  **SVM Filtering**: Classifiers trained to detect adversarial updates (offline on shadow updates).
-  **FHE (CKKS)**: Enables inference over encrypted model updates.
-  **Attack-Resilience**: Tested against Backdoor Attacks, Gradient Ascent, and Label Flipping.
